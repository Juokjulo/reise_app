<h3>About us</h3>
<p>

We are Elisabeth (25) and Frieder (25) and we want to see more of the world.</br>
On this website we document our cycle tour through Europe and Asia. Our tour started in August 2017 in Croatia. After his bachelor thesis in mechanical engineering Frieder wanted to travel for maybe three months. When Elisabeth said, she wanted to join him, the plan became to travel more than three months. We are planning to travel a year, maybe more or less. Elisabeth quitted her job as a system engineer.
